      I'm so excited that you made it to this site!  Welcome to Molly's Virtual Book Club,
      a place to connect with other bibliophiles in a virtual setting.  I'm an avid reader, 
      self-proclaimed bibliophile, and always looking to connect with other book lovers, which 
      is why I made this site. Books update once per season, so you'll have more than enough time
      to accomplish your reading goals (no weekly requirements!).  
      </p>
      <p>
      You can revisit archived books
      and share comments so long as someone else is willing to join in.
      Joining a book club can be time-consuming and sometimes a little awkward.  Here, you won't feel
      pressured to attend meetings and can freely share your thoughts.
      Share your favorite books with me using the Make a Recommendation Page, 
      and join me on an adventure you'll never forget!
