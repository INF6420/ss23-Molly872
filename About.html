      <p>
        I'm so excited that you made it to this site! Welcome to Molly's Virtual
        Book Club, a place to connect with other bibliophiles in a virtual
        setting. I'm an avid reader, self-proclaimed bibliophile, and always
        looking to connect with other book lovers, which is why I made this
        site. Books update once per season, so you'll have more than enough time
        to accomplish your reading goals (no weekly requirements!). You can
        revisit archived books and share comments so long as someone else is
        willing to join in. Joining a book club can be time-consuming and
        sometimes a little awkward. Here, you won't feel pressured to attend
        meetings and can freely share your thoughts. Share your favorite books
        with me using the Make a Recommendation Page, and join me on an
        adventure you'll never forget!
